So enter in that folder (`cd ~/gh-contributions`) and run `node server` or directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode ~/gh-contributions/server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe application runs on the port `9000`. Open your browser at `http://localhost:9000/` there you will see the contribution designer. You will draw the commits. A JSON object is generated:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"coordinates\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"x\": ...,\r\n            \"y\": ...\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n        {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"commitsPerDay\": 40\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the `commitsPerDay` value. That sets the day commit count.\r\nThen click the generate button and wait... :-) You can delight with the debug messages from terminal while the repository is generated.\r\n\r\nAfter the repository is finished you will get a link for download. Unzip the zip file, add your remote git repository and run `git push -u origin master`.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDesign your GitHub contributions calendar using the designer from the browser:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/n5gjb0T.png)\r\n\r\nA repo will be generated. After pushing it to GitHub, your profile will look like this:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Z8c1Ed0.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
